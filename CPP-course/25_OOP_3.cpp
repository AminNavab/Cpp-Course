// Polymorphism:
// Polymorphism means "many forms",
//              and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
// Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
//            Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
//            This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

// NOTE: Polymorphism means inheritance with changes in objects of the parent class.
// Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?
//          It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.
